- Overall accuracy: 88.9% (8/9 correct)
- Truthful claim accuracy: 100% (7/7)
- Lying claim accuracy: 50% (1/2), harder than mock; classifier partially transfers
- Average questions asked (adaptive): 3.0 per interrogation
- Key observation: the single lying misclassification had very high confidence (0.92),
  confirming the calibration problem noted in the mock study
- Limitation: small pilot (n=9 completed); 17 additional trials failed due to API rate limits
- Interpretation: framework transfers to real LLMs with reduced lying detection accuracy
  compared to mock (50% vs 82%), suggesting mock patterns are simpler than real LLM behaviour

CRITICAL: The reviewer specifically called out missing these areas. You MUST include them:
1. §2.1 Human Deception Detection: polygraph (\\cite{{raskin1988polygraph}}), micro-expressions
   (\\cite{{ekman2003emotions}}). Explain why physical tells don't apply to LLMs.
2. §2.2 Adversarial Examples and Prompt Injection: \\cite{{goodfellow2014explaining}},
   \\cite{{perez2022ignore}}. These differ from intentional model deception (different threat model).
3. §2.3 Representation Engineering and Probing Classifiers (REQUIRED, reviewer called this out):
   - \\cite{{zou2023representation}}: representation engineering finds deception-related directions
     in activation space (white-box, requires model internals)
   - \\cite{{burns2022discovering}}: probing classifiers for model honesty (white-box)
   - Contrast with our black-box behavioral approach: no model internals needed
4. §2.4 Sycophancy, Sandbagging, and AI Safety Risks (REQUIRED, reviewer called this out):
   - \\cite{{hubinger2019risks}}: deceptive alignment in advanced AI systems
   - \\cite{{perez2022discovering}}: sycophancy in LLMs
   - Note this paper addresses instructed roleplay, not autonomous strategic deception

   - \\cite{{ganguli2022red}}: red-teaming language models at scale
   - \\cite{{perez2022red}}: red teaming with LMs

interrogation with confidence-based early stopping for black-box deception detection."

    "methodology": """Write the LaTeX content for the Methodology section (REVISED).
Use \\section{{Methodology}} with subsections. Target ~1000 words.

CRITICAL CHANGES required by reviewer:
1. §3.1 System Overview: Use a REAL TikZ diagram (not a placeholder fbox). Write the full
   LaTeX TikZ code for a horizontal pipeline diagram:
   \\usepackage{{tikz}} is already in preamble.
   Draw five boxes connected by arrows:
   [Target Model] → [Interrogator] → [Feature Extractor] → [Classifier] → [Adaptive Controller]
   with a feedback arrow from [Adaptive Controller] back to [Interrogator].
   Use \\begin{{figure}}[t] \\centering \\begin{{tikzpicture}}...\\end{{tikzpicture}} \\caption{{...}}
   \\label{{fig:architecture}} \\end{{figure}}

2. §3.2 Target Model: truth/lie mode system prompts (verbatim in \\begin{{verbatim}}).
   IMPORTANT: Add a subsection "§3.2.3 Scope Note" explicitly stating: "The target operates
   in cooperative roleplay mode: it is instructed to defend a false claim. This is distinct
   from autonomous deceptive behaviour where a model strategically misleads without instruction.
   We study the former as a tractable experimental proxy."

3. §3.3 Interrogation Strategy: question generation with LLM, question taxonomy.

4. §3.4 Feature Extraction: table with \\label{{tab:behavioral_features}} (NOT tab:features;
   this avoids duplicate label conflict). Include 5 features with descriptions and why-it-matters.
   ALSO add a paragraph: "Feature validity note: scores are assigned by an LLM judge, introducing
   circularity: the extractor may capture stylistic artifacts of the prompts rather than genuine
   deception signals. No ground-truth validation of feature scores was performed."

5. §3.5 Classification: logistic regression. Add: "We choose logistic regression for
   interpretability; feature coefficients reveal which behavioral signals drive predictions."

6. §3.6 Adaptive Stopping: formal equation. Use \\begin{{equation}} for the stopping rule.

{real_llm}

Research documentation:
{{doc}}
""",

    "experiments": """Write the LaTeX content for the Experiments section (MAJOR REVISION).
Use \\section{{Experiments}}. Target ~1300 words.

CRITICAL CHANGES required by reviewer:

§4.1 Experimental Setup:
- Clearly state: "All mock experiments use deterministic pattern-matching models (MockTargetModel).
  Statistics are descriptive: p-values are not meaningful for deterministic processes and are
  omitted from this revision."
- Table of hyperparameters.
- Claims used (truth/lie examples).

§4.2 Core Detection Accuracy (n=100, NOT n=10):
Use the n=100 mock results: Adaptive: 91% accuracy (truthful: 100%, lying: 82%), avg 2.0 questions.
Do NOT report 100% perfect accuracy; that was the flawed n=10 result. Use:
\\begin{{table}}[h] \\centering \\caption{{Adaptive system accuracy on n=100 mock interrogations}}
Show: overall acc=91%, truthful acc=100%, lying acc=82%, precision=1.00, recall=0.82, F1=0.901.

§4.3 Adaptive vs. Fixed Baseline (n=100):
Adaptive: 91% accuracy, 2.0 avg questions. Fixed (8Q): 100% accuracy, 8.0 avg questions.
Efficiency gain: 75% fewer questions. IMPORTANT: add caveat, "The fixed baseline always asks
8 questions; this number is arbitrary. On the deterministic mock setup, even 1 question may
suffice. The efficiency result demonstrates that early stopping works on mock patterns, but
the absolute question counts should not be interpreted as evidence for real-world efficiency."
Remove p-values and Cohen's d from this comparison (mock is deterministic, statistics misleading).

§4.4 Feature Importance:
Open-ended questions 58% more diagnostic than detail probes (0.280 vs 0.177 avg confidence change).
Effect size d=0.91 is meaningful here (this compares question types, not systems). Keep this result.

§4.5 Confidence Trajectory:
Table showing confidence by question number. Discussion of diminishing returns.

§4.6 Failure Analysis:
Only 0.04 confidence gap between correct (0.88) and incorrect (0.84) predictions.
Interpret this clearly as a calibration failure, not a subtle distinction.

§4.7 Real LLM Pilot (NEW, directly addresses reviewer concern #1):
"To assess whether the framework transfers beyond mock models, we conducted a pilot evaluation
using Claude Haiku 4.5 (\\cite{{anthropic2024claude}}) via AWS Bedrock as the target model,
a production-grade LLM, not a pattern-matching mock."
Results table: n=9 completed, 88.9% overall, 100% truthful, 50% lying, avg 3.0 questions.
Discuss: (1) truthful detection transfers well, (2) lying detection harder on real LLMs (50% vs 82%),
(3) the misclassification had 0.92 confidence (calibration failure confirmed on real model),
(4) pilot is underpowered (n=9) but provides directional signal.
End with: "Full validation on real LLMs at scale remains as future work."

All tables must use \\begin{{table}}[h] \\centering \\caption{{...}} \\label{{tab:...}}

    "discussion": """Write the LaTeX content for the Discussion section (REVISED).
Use \\section{{Discussion}} with structured subsections. Target ~600 words.

CRITICAL restructuring required by reviewer:

§5.1 Key Findings: 3 bullet paragraphs; adaptive efficiency, confidence convergence, question type.

§5.2 Instructed Roleplay vs. Genuine Deception (REQUIRED, reviewer said this was inadequate):
Write a DEDICATED subsection (not buried in limitations) making this explicit:
"The experimental setting in this paper involves instructed cooperative roleplay: the target model
is given an explicit system prompt instructing it to defend a specific false claim. This is
fundamentally different from the AI safety scenario of autonomous strategic deception
\\cite{{hubinger2019risks}}, where a model independently chooses to mislead. Our setting is closer
to testing whether a verifier can distinguish \\emph{{prompted lying}} from \\emph{{prompted truth-telling}}.
This is a tractable experimental proxy for studying behavioral detection methods, but findings
may not generalise to models that deceive without instruction."

§5.3 Feature Extraction Validity (REQUIRED, reviewer raised circularity issue):
"The five behavioral features are scored by an LLM judge (Claude Haiku). This introduces
circularity: the extractor may be sensitive to surface-level stylistic differences between
truth and lie prompts rather than genuine deception signals. There is no ground-truth annotation
of feature scores, and no human inter-rater reliability study was conducted. Future work
should validate features against human judgments or interpretability methods
\\cite{{zou2023representation}}."

§5.4 Limitations: cover remaining issues:
(a) Mock model testing (all confirmed by real LLM pilot)
(b) Small sample sizes and need for scale
(c) Classifier overfitting risk (trained on same mock distribution tested on)
(d) Confidence calibration failure (narrow 0.04 gap; 0.92 confidence on wrong prediction in pilot)
(e) Limited claim diversity (subjective claims untested)
(f) Efficiency claims: "the 75% question reduction is an artifact of early information gain on
    deterministic mock patterns; this number should not be taken as an estimate for real deployments"

§5.5 Implications: AI safety red-teaming, black-box complement to probing, future directions.
